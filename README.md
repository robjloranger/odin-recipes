# Recipes Website

> The 1st project in The Odin Project, Foundations pathway.

## Overview

The project is to build a simple recipe website.

This website will start out ugly, with just an index and a handful of recipes.

Later the pathway will expand on the HTML basics and add styling.

## Skills etc

In the project we will learn basics of HTML elements and linking local pages within the site.

## Recipe Credits
