    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Easy to make and delicious. This hearty rice and mushroom soup will have you asking for seconds.</p>
    <p>You can use wild rice instead but see the notes for instructions.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <h3>For the Soup</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp dairy free butter</li>
        <li>1 medium white onion, chopped</li>
        <li>16 ounces of mushrooms, half chopped and half sliced thinly</li>
        <li>1 cup your favorite rice blend, i.e. multicolor jasmine and brown rice</li>
        <li>4 cups veggie broth</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp fresh rosemary, chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp dry thyme</li>
        <li>3 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>5 medium carrots, chopped</li>
        <li>3 stalks of celery, chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the Cream</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup raw cashews</li>
        <li>3/4 cup water</li>
        <li>1 tbsp white miso</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak the cashews in boiling water, enough to at least cover them.</li>
        <li>Set your instant pot to saute and add the butter, onion and <b>sliced</b> mushrooms. Cooking until soft.
        </li>
        <li>Add the broth, rice, salt and spices. Set your instant pot to high pressure for 15 minutes. While this comes
            to pressure you can chop your carrots and celery and mince the garlic.</li>
        <li>Once the 15 minutes are up, manually release the pressure and add the carrots, celery, <b>chopped</b>
            mushrooms and garlic. Then set the instant pot back to high pressure for another 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the soup finishes cooking, drain the cashews and add to a blender with
            the water and miso, blend until smooth.</li>
        <li>When the time is up, manually release the pressure and stir in the creamy cashew sauce.</li>
        <li>Serve with <a href="easy-focaccia.html">fresh focaccia or other bread.</a></li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Notes:</h3>
    <p>You can substitute the rice for wild rice but the first pressure cook will need to be about 20 minutes instead of
        15.</p>
